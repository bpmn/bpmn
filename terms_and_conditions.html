which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our
defense of these claims.</p>

<p>The failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision
of this Agreement will in no manner affect such party’s right at a later time
to enforce the same. A waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement
will not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or
other provisions of this Agreement.</p>
